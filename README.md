# Connect Four Adversarial AI Game Engine (Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning)

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent, real-time adversarial game engine for Connect Four (6x7 grid) built with Python and Pygame. The computer agent utilizes the Minimax decision algorithm augmented with Alpha-Beta pruning and a multi-factor positional evaluation heuristic to achieve near-optimal, unbeatable gameplay against human opponents.

## Problem Statement

Connect Four presents a discrete state space of over 4.5 trillion valid configurations, making exhaustive state search impossible in real-time interactive gameplay. Game AI systems require optimized adversarial search strategies that integrate heuristic positional evaluation (sliding-window board scoring, center-column bias, and threat detection) with depth-limited Minimax and Alpha-Beta branch pruning to achieve unbeatable strategic gameplay against human opponents.

## System Architecture and Workflow

The game state loop coordinates user input, board state representation, adversarial search trees, and graphical rendering:

## Key Features

- **Adversarial Minimax Engine**: Simulates prospective game state trajectories recursively across configurable search depths.
- **Alpha-Beta Branch Pruning**: Dynamically prunes sub-optimal search branches, significantly reducing the evaluated node count and enabling deep lookahead without computational lag.
- **Positional Heuristic Evaluation**:
 - Center-column bias (prioritizing high-mobility vertical lanes).
 - 4-in-a-row terminal scoring (+100,000 / win).
 - 3-in-a-row offensive setup (+5 points) and defensive threat blocking.
 - 2-in-a-row developmental positional evaluation (+2 points).
- **Interactive Pygame Interface**: Smooth graphical rendering with real-time cursor tracking, gravity drop animations, dynamic winner detection overlays, and restart capabilities.

## Heuristic Scoring Weights

The position evaluation function scans all 4-cell sliding windows across horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal orientations:

| Board Pattern (Window of 4 Cells) | Score Contribution | Strategy Focus |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **4 AI Pieces** | +100 | Immediate Terminal Victory |
| **3 AI Pieces + 1 Empty Slot** | +5 | High-Probability Threat Creation |
| **2 AI Pieces + 2 Empty Slots** | +2 | Early Territory & Line Construction |
| **3 Opponent Pieces + 1 Empty Slot** | -4 | Immediate Defensive Blocking |
| **Center Column Occupation** | +3 per token | Maximizing Future Multi-Directional Lines |
